    \(2\) Provide hands-on training in the use of tools and software that facilitate reproducibility

    \(3\) Guide researchers on how to properly document and organize data and project outcomes to foster open science

    \(4\) Encourage collaboration among tutorial participants to foster a community that values and practices reproducible research

    This tutorial is organized by Cathy Wu (Assistant Professor at MIT), Bidisha Ghosh (Associate Professor at Trinity College Dublin), Irene Mart√≠nez (Assistant Professor at the TU Delft), and Zuduo Zheng (Professor at the University of Queensland). **More information will be announced soon**.
